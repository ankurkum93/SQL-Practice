Letâ€™s assume that we have 3 tables:
Cutomers:
Customer_id 
Name
Town

Orders:
Order_id
Customer_id
Order_date

Order_items:
Order_item_id
Order_id
product_id
Quantity
Unit_price

Provide the number of customers who spent during the last month
-	From 0 and 200 
-	From 200 and 500 
-	And from 500 and 1000 

select count(o.customer_id),
case(
    when qty*unit_price<=200 then 'range1'
    when qty*unit_price >200 and qty*unit_price<=500 'range2'
    when qty*unit_price >500 and qty*unit_price <=1000 'range3'
     ) 
     
     from
     order_items oi
     join
     orders o
     using(order_id)
     group by
     case(
    when qty*unit_price<=200 then 'range1'
    when qty*unit_price >200 and qty*unit_price<=500 'range2'
    when qty*unit_price >500 and qty*unit_price <=1000 'range3'
     ) 
     order by o.customer_id
     
     with price as (
select customer_id, sum(quantity*unit_price) as total_spent
from
     order_items oi
     join
     orders o
     using(order_id)
     group by
     customer_id) 
     select count(customer_id), case
     (

         when total_spent>200 and total_spent<=500 then 'range2'
         when total_spent >500 and total_spent<=100 then 'range3') as range
         from price
         group by case
     (

         when total_spent>200 and total_spent<=500 then 'range2'
         when total_spent >500 and total_spent<=100 then 'range3')
     
     
     Provide the 3rd order done by the customer named John since the beginning of this month 
     select Order_id from
     Orders O
     join Cutomers C
     using (Customer_id)
     where lower(c.name) like '%john%'
     and where Order_date between '2021/03/01' and '2021/03/24'
     
     
     Provide the list of items that were ordered by 3 different customers during the 30 days
     
     select order_id, count(distinct customer_id)
     from
     ....
     group by order_id
     having count(distinct customer_id) = 3
